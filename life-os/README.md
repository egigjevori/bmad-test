## What is Life OS?

Life OS is a privacy-first personal dashboard that helps you build better daily habits, track your emotional wellbeing, capture fleeting thoughts, and stay focused on what matters.

All your data stays in your browser - nothing is sent to any server.

## Features

### Habit Tracker
Track your daily habits and watch your streaks grow. Mark habits as complete, skipped, or missed. See your progress at a glance with streak counters.

### Mood Logger
Log how you're feeling on a simple 1-5 scale using emoji faces. Add context with tags like "Calm", "Focused", or "Stressed". View trends over time.

### Quick Notes
Capture thoughts, ideas, quotes, links, or tasks with zero friction. Pin important notes to keep them visible. Organize with tags.

### Pomodoro Timer
Stay focused with work sessions (25 min) and breaks (5 min). Visual ring shows remaining time. Track completed sessions.

### Daily Journal
Write daily reflections with optional writing prompts. Auto-saves as you type. Word count included.

### Bottom Bar "Heartbeat"
See your life patterns at a glance. Each day is color-coded based on your activity. Tap any day to see a summary. Navigate your personal timeline.

### Customizable Dashboard
Drag widgets to rearrange. Resize to fit your workflow. Enable or disable widgets in settings. Your layout is saved automatically.

### Dark Mode
Follows your system preference automatically. Override manually in settings. Smooth transitions between themes.
