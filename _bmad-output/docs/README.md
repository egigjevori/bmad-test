## How This Documentation Was Created

All documents were generated using BMAD workflows:

1. `/create-product-brief` - Product Brief
2. `/create-architecture` - Architecture
3. `/create-prd` - PRD
4. `/create-ux-design` - UX Design
5. `/create-epics-and-stories` - Epics
6. `/generate-project-context` - AI Context

The PROCESS.md was maintained manually throughout development.
